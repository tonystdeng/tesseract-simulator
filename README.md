This is a 4D cube, aka a Tesseract simulator, with the 3D engine completely designed from scratch

To play, please install python and its following libraries:
-pygame
-numpy
-numba(optional, for extra optimization)

after you have all the requirements, and made sure all four python script is in the same directory, run the "main.py" file.
then you will see a beautiful tesseract rotate in a 4D way! you can use wasd to control positions and arrow keys to control angels
